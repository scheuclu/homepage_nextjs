description: "This project came out of an interview task I once had to complete.\n

The goals is to implement a fully working calculator, without using any of the standard libraries.\n

The calculator is able to accept arbitrary string that represent and expression or equation and solve it.\n"

The goal of this project was to implement a calculator from scratch.
Notably, I wanted to do it without the use of any sophisticated libraries.

Here's the feature specification:

 - Infix and Reverse Polish notation are supported.
 - Parentheses are supported.
 - Basic arithmatic as well as trigonometric functions are supported.
 - Supports basic constants such as Eulers number or Pi.
 - The calculator can solve for one unknown in a linear equation.
 - Proper error handling
 - Fully tested, of course.

The implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/scheuclu/OverkillCalculator).
